# Agent Browser Runtime

Agent Browser Runtime is a compose-managed real Chrome runtime for AI agents. It gives each agent a leased Chrome Tab Group, a persistent browser profile, noVNC human handoff, artifact capture, extractor jobs, humanized pacing, and an explicit browser-consistency layer.

The point is simple: agents work through a shared, visible browser runtime instead of fighting over ad hoc headless sessions.

## Responsible use only

This project is published only for learning, research, and responsible technical exploration.

You must comply with applicable laws, platform terms, privacy rules, account-safety boundaries, and rate-limit or access-control policies. Do not use Agent Browser Runtime for illegal activity, unauthorized access, credential or session abuse, privacy-invasive collection, spam, fraud, harassment, or any attempt to harm, overload, or disrupt a service.

If a target requires login, consent, payment, Captcha, MFA, or another human/account-safety checkpoint, use manual handoff and respect the outcome.

Commercial use, resale, commercial hosted service use, paid product integration, or use primarily intended to support commercial activity requires a separate written commercial license from the repository owner or copyright holder.

## What is included

- Broker: Node/Fastify HTTP + WebSocket control plane for leases, jobs, artifacts, pacing, and state.
- Browser runtime: Chromium/Chrome in Docker with CDP, Xvfb, x11vnc, noVNC, and a persistent profile mount.
- TLS gateway: local HTTP proxy service wired into Chromium at launch time, with gateway health/stats surfaced by the broker.
- Companion extension: Chrome extension that owns real tabs, real Tab Groups, debugger/CDP calls, screenshots, HTML capture, session probes, humanized primitives, and real UI action primitives.
- CLI: `./cli/brs.js` for status, fetch, session probes, extractor jobs, artifacts, and leases.
- Skills: Codex and OpenClaw compatible skill folders under `skills/`.
- Examples: generic extractors plus public platform extractor examples. Private/internal extractors are intentionally out of tree.

## Quick start

```bash
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up --build -d
./scripts/smoke-test.sh
```

To enable a mounted `fingerprint-chromium` binary, set `BRS_FINGERPRINT_CHROMIUM_HOST_PATH` to a host directory containing `chrome-wrapper` or `chrome`, then start with the overlay:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.fingerprint.yml up --build -d
```

Open noVNC when a login, challenge, or manual inspection is needed:

```bash
open 'http://127.0.0.1:16080/vnc.html?autoconnect=true&resize=remote'
```

Quick manual checks:

```bash
./cli/brs.js status
./cli/brs.js fetch https://example.com --agent demo-agent --task smoke --screenshot --humanize enhanced
```

Expected outputs: broker status, HTML artifact, screenshot artifact, and a real Chrome Tab Group visible in noVNC. TLS gateway health is reported when the optional gateway browser proxy is enabled.

`./cli/brs.js status` also reports `stealth.mode`, whether legacy JS/CDP stealth overrides are active, and whether the startup-level TLS gateway proxy is configured and active.
The default runtime preset is `trusted-real-browser`: the browser keeps its real UA, UA-CH, platform, WebGL, canvas, audio, timezone, WebDriver launch behavior, and TLS path unless you explicitly opt into a spoofing mode. When the fingerprint overlay is used, `status.browserRuntime.fingerprintChromium.active` reports whether the mounted binary was actually selected.
It also reports the loaded runtime fingerprint summary from the extension when a fingerprint profile is generated.
The `BRS_*` environment prefix is kept as the stable Browser Runtime Service config surface.

## Browser identity modes

The default mode is `trusted-real-browser`. It favors high-trust site compatibility by avoiding page-level spoofing and keeping browser identity surfaces native to the running browser, without startup-level timezone or AutomationControlled overrides. This is the right baseline for login, checkout, account-safety, and other sensitive flows.

- Real browser runtime instead of pure headless fetches.
- Persistent Chrome profile for login-state reuse, cookies, localStorage, and extension state.
- noVNC human handoff for login, Captcha, slider, MFA, and account-safety checkpoints.
- Real Chrome Tab Groups so concurrent agents have visible, lease-scoped workspaces.
- Platform cooldowns plus per-job humanized warmup, mousemove, scroll, and pause primitives.
- All-site browser interaction discipline: after the initial exact URL/probe entry point, agents must complete workflows through visible UI controls with keyboard input, cursor movement/clicking, scrolling, hover, and pauses instead of synthesized URL jumps, querystring shortcuts, DOM-click dispatch, or backend/API shortcuts.
- Runtime UI action primitives exposed through `/tabs/:tabId/ui/*` and extractor `ui` helpers: `move`, `click`, `type`, `press`, `scroll`, and `waitFor`.
- Optional `legacy-js` mode: CDP header/UA/locale/timezone overrides plus main-world patches for webdriver, languages, platform, vendor, plugins/mimeTypes, Chrome runtime stubs, permissions, media codecs, WebGL, canvas, and audio surfaces.
- Optional `patched-browser` mode: use a mounted browser binary such as fingerprint Chromium and let the browser backend own identity changes instead of extension injection.
- Optional startup-level TLS gateway proxy with QUIC disabled on the proxied path and health/stats surfaced in `status`; it is opt-in by default to avoid transport/browser mismatches.
- High-trust login-host exclusions through `BRS_STEALTH_EXCLUDED_HOSTS`; Google, LinkedIn, JD, and GitHub are excluded from legacy JS stealth by default because spoofing can harm account login flows.

This is compatibility infrastructure for legitimate real-browser agent work, not a promise that any platform will accept automation. Use noVNC for login, Captcha, slider, or account-safety handoff. For aggressive bot-detection sites, prefer persistent profiles, headed/noVNC use, matching locale/timezone/proxy geography, and browser-level identity consistency over page-level spoofing.
Runtime upgrades preserve the persisted browser profile by default; set `BRS_RESET_PROFILE_ON_SIGNATURE_CHANGE=1` only when you intentionally want to wipe cookies/profile state after a signature change.

## Session probes

Use the shared probe endpoint to check whether a persisted browser profile still looks logged in on a platform:

```bash
./cli/brs.js probe-session linkedin --humanize off
./cli/brs.js probe-session reddit --screenshot --save-html
```

The probe writes a `session-probe` artifact and returns `connected`, `reason`, `errorCode`, auth cookie names, expiry, current URL, and lightweight page signals. Cookie values are omitted unless `--include-cookies` is passed.
Use `--include-storage-state` only when you intentionally need a Playwright-style export with cookie and storage values. Platform cooldowns are enabled by default (`reddit=45s`, `facebook=60s`, `linkedin=180s`, `instagram=240s`) and can be bypassed per probe with `--cooldown false`.

## Platform extractors

```bash
./cli/brs.js extract example.extract.js https://example.com --agent demo-agent --task extractor-smoke --screenshot --save-html
```

The repository ships extractor scripts under `extractors/` to show how stable site workflows can be packaged behind the broker job API. Extractors export an optional params schema plus `extract({ url, finalUrl, pageHtml, tab, ui, params, attempt })`, and can use the runtime's real UI helpers before reading fresh HTML.

Current examples:

- `example.extract.js` — minimal HTML/title extraction smoke test.
- `failing.extract.js` — intentional failure fixture for retry and error artifacts.
- `reddit.extract.js` — public Reddit platform example. Feed URLs return thread summaries; thread URLs return post text plus visible comments, with optional UI-driven comment expansion.

Example Reddit feed run:

```bash
./cli/brs.js extract reddit.extract.js 'https://www.reddit.com/r/<subreddit>/new/' \
  --agent demo-agent \
  --task reddit-feed \
  --params '{"mode":"feed","limit":10,"sinceHours":72,"maxFeedScrolls":8}' \
  --screenshot \
  --save-html
```

Example Reddit thread run:

```bash
./cli/brs.js extract reddit.extract.js 'https://www.reddit.com/r/<subreddit>/comments/<thread_id>/<slug>/' \
  --agent demo-agent \
  --task reddit-thread \
  --params '{"mode":"thread","expandComments":true,"maxCommentExpansionRounds":8,"maxCommentExpansionClicks":4}'
```

The Reddit extractor works from the browser-rendered page HTML and broker UI primitives; it does not use Reddit JSON/API endpoints and does not contain credentials, cookies, local paths, or a fixed subreddit list.

### Reddit validation snapshot

A representative local validation run used the runtime with persisted login state and conservative pacing against a 30-subreddit Reddit collection set. The collector stored output outside this repository; the numbers below are aggregate counts only.

Snapshot time: `2026-05-20T01:10:54Z`

| Metric | Result |
| --- | ---: |
| Continuous validation window | 95.8 hours |
| Completed batches | 25 |
| Historical bootstrap batches | 1 |
| Realtime update batches | 24 |
| Persisted Reddit threads | 5,880 |
| Persisted Reddit comments | 55,190 |
| Subreddit sources with persisted threads | 28 |
| Bootstrap evidence rows | 4,405 |
| Realtime evidence rows | 2,481 |
| Latest completed realtime batch duration | 2.1 hours |
| Latest completed realtime batch evidence rows | 97 |

This snapshot is a functional validation result, not a throughput guarantee. Runtime speed depends on platform state, account state, cooldown policy, UI expansion depth, network conditions, and manual handoff events.

Default host CDP port is `19223` to avoid conflicts with other local browser services.
